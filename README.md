# odin-recipes

Okay so this project will be one of my first real real by myself projects so here we go.

Alright so I am just going to create a simple recipes website that has no css or javascript just
 html that's it.

I'ma do my favorite foods so this will make it a little bit fun for me or maybe best sandwiches 
or things to put into a sandwich IDK I'll do my best is all I know not really much of a planner.
